# odin-recipes

My name is Nicole, people call me Nikki. I started learning with The Odin Project in August 2023. Im going to be continuing to 
brush up on my skills in HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. They said that the project, when finsihed, won't look pretty but later on in
the courses we will be touching up the CSS. As I learn more about the project I will include more information in this file. I know 
that it is going to be a Reciepes website and thats all im aware of at the moment. Happy Hacking!
